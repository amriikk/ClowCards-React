## Introduction
The Cards were created by the half-English, half-Chinese top sorcerer Clow Reed. They are the result of the combination of Eastern and Western magic and formed the basis for a new kind of magic unlike any other seen so far. To contain the incredible power of the cards, Clow had the cards sealed in the Clow Book after his death, only to be released when the "chosen one" appears.

The cards represent a combination of Eastern and Western magic centered on the concepts of natural forces and elements. The original Clow Cards fall under a specific sign, the sun or moon, and correspond to the guardians Cerberus and Yue.
